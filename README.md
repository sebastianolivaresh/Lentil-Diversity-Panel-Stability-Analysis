# Lentil-Diversity-Panel-Stability-Analysis
Non-parametric stability analysis of 324 accessions from a lentil diversity panel with STABILITYSOFT

An evaluation of the normality of phenotype data showed that data was non-normal.

The STABILITYSOFT software was used to get non-parametric stability statistics for seed shape traits: circularity, diameter, height and plumpness.
Other well known phenological traits (DTF:days to flowering; DTM: days to maturity; DTS: days to swollen pods) were used as a reference
to evaluate the overall stability of 324 accessions across six locations.

Each of the files contains columns with the genotype number or name (accession number) and different stability measures 
that were then analyzed.
